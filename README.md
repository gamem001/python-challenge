## PyBank

* In this project I use Python to analyze the financial records of a ficticious company. The dataset is only composed of two columns: "Date" and "Profits/Losses"

* The Python script will analyze each of the following:

  * The total number of months included in the dataset

  * The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period

  * The average of the changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period

  * The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period

  * The greatest decrease in losses (date and amount) over the entire period

* The analysis will look similar to the one below:

  ```text
  Financial Analysis
  ----------------------------
  Total Months: 86
  Total: $38382578
  Average  Change: $-2315.12
  Greatest Increase in Profits: Feb-2012 ($1926159)
  Greatest Decrease in Profits: Sep-2013 ($-2196167)
  ```

* In conclusion, the final script will both print the analysis to the terminal and export a text file with the results.

## PyPoll

* In this half of the project, Python script will be used to help a small ficticious town modernize the vote counting process.

* The dataset is composed of three columns: `Voter ID`, `County`, and `Candidate`. The Python script will analyze the votes and calculate each of the following:

  * The total number of votes cast

  * A complete list of candidates who received votes

  * The percentage of votes each candidate won

  * The total number of votes each candidate won

  * The winner of the election based on popular vote.

* The analysis will look similar to the one below:

  ```text
  Election Results
  -------------------------
  Total Votes: 3521001
  -------------------------
  Khan: 63.000% (2218231)
  Correy: 20.000% (704200)
  Li: 14.000% (492940)
  O'Tooley: 3.000% (105630)
  -------------------------
  Winner: Khan
  -------------------------
  ```

* In addition, the final script will both print the analysis to the terminal and export a text file with the results.
